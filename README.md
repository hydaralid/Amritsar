The tourism website was meticulously crafted using a combination of frontend components,
including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while PHP served as the backend component. MySQL 
was employed as the database management system to ensure efficient data storage and retrieval.
The entire project was developed within the VS Code environment, with XAMPP facilitating its
deployment on a local server for testing andvrefinement.
This comprehensive approach enabled seamless integration of user-facing elements and backend
functionality, resulting in a professional-grade web application designed to provide an
immersive and informative experience for visitors.
